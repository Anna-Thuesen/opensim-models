OpenSim enables users to create custom studies, including investigating the effects of musculoskeletal geometry, joint kinematics, and muscle-tendon properties on the forces and joint moments that the muscles can produce. With OpenSim, our goal is to provide a framework that allows the biomechanics community to create, share, and extend a library of models and dynamic simulation tools to study and quantify human and animal movement.\n","\n","**Purpose**\n","\n","The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce users to the [Conda OpenSim](https://anaconda.org/opensim-org/opensim) package, that allows the use of the library in [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).
